  summary: A fake file system that mocks the Python file system modules.

  description: |
    pyfakefs implements a fake file system that mocks the Python file system
    modules. Using pyfakefs, your tests operate on a fake file system in
    memory without touching the real disk. The software under test requires
    no modification to work with pyfakefs. pyfakefs works with Linux, Windows
    and MacOS.
